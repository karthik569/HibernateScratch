HibernateScratch
================

While following javabrains.koushik.org's hibernate tutorial, documented the examples and thought they might help some-one.

Git branches are named according the tutorial they represent. Switch to respective branch for examples explained in that tutorial.

Note:

1) I used maven for dependency management rather adding external jars to the build path except for mysql-connector.
2) Before running it make appropriate changes to hibernate configuration file. (DB, username & password)
3) You'll find a slightly different way of configuring EhCache as second level cache. Please find the link
   provided in "pom.xml" on the same.
